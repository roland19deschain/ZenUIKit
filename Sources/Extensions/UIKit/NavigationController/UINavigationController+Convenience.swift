	///   This object cannot be a tab bar controller. If the view controller is already on the navigation stack,
	///   this method throws an exception.
	///   - animated: Specify _true_ to animate the transition or _false_ if you do not want
	///   the transition to be animated. You might specify _false_ if you are
	///   setting up the navigation controller at launch time.
	///   - completion: The closure to be executed at the end of the animation.

	///   - animated: Set this value to _true_ to animate the transition.
	///   - completion: The closure to be executed at the end of the animation.
	/// - Returns: The view controller that was popped from the stack.

	/// Replaces the view controllers currently managed by the navigation controller
	/// with the specified items.
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - viewControllers: The view controllers to place in the stack.
	///   The front-to-back order of the controllers in this array represents the new bottom-to-top
	///   order of the controllers in the navigation stack. Thus, the last item added to the array
	///   becomes the top item of the navigation stack.
	///   - animated: If true, animate the pushing or popping of the top view controller.
	///   If false, replace the view controllers without any animations.
	///   - completion: The block to execute after the view controller is dismissed.
	///   This block has no return value and takes no parameters.
